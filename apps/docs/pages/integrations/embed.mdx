# Embed

The Embed allows your website visitors to book a meeting with you directly from your website.

## Install on any website

- _Step-1._ Install the Vanilla JS Snippet

  ```javascript
  (function (C, A, L) {
    let p = function (a, ar) {
      a.q.push(ar);
    };
    let d = C.document;
    C.Cal =
      C.Cal ||
      function () {
        let cal = C.Cal;
        let ar = arguments;
        if (!cal.loaded) {
          cal.ns = {};
          cal.q = cal.q || [];
          d.head.appendChild(d.createElement("script")).src = A;
          cal.loaded = true;
        }
        if (ar[0] === L) {
          const api = function () {
            p(api, arguments);
          };
          const namespace = ar[1];
          api.q = api.q || [];
          typeof namespace === "string" ? (cal.ns[namespace] = api) && p(api, ar) : p(cal, ar);
          return;
        }
        p(cal, ar);
      };
  })(window, "https://cal.com/embed.js", "init");
  ```

- _Step-2_. Initialize it

  ```javascript
  Cal("init")
  ```

## Install with a Framework

### embed-react

It provides a react component `<Cal>` that can be used to show the embed inline at that place.

```bash
yarn add @calcom/embed-react
```

### Any XYZ Framework

You can use Vanilla JS Snippet to install

## Popular ways in which you can embed on your website

Assuming that you have followed the steps of installing and initializing the snippet, you can show the embed in following ways:

### Inline

Show the embed inline inside a container element. It would take the width and height of the container element.

  <summary>_Vanilla JS_</summary>

```javascript
Cal("inline", {
  elementOrSelector: "Your Embed Container Selector Path", // You can also provide an element directly
  calLink: "jane", // The link that you want to embed. It would open https://cal.com/jane in embed
  config: {
    name: "John Doe", // Prefill Name
    email: "johndoe@gmail.com", // Prefill Email
    notes: "Test Meeting", // Prefill Notes
    guests: ["janedoe@gmail.com", "test@gmail.com"], // Prefill Guests
    theme: "dark", // "dark" or "light" theme
  },
});
```

</details>

####

<details>
<summary>_React_</summary>

```jsx
import Cal from "@calcom/embed-react";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Cal
    calLink="pro"
    config={{
      name: "John Doe",
      email: "johndoe@gmail.com",
      notes: "Test Meeting",
      guests: ["janedoe@gmail.com"],
      theme: "dark",
    }}
  />
);
```

</details>

### Popup on any existing element

To show the embed as a popup on clicking an element, add `data-cal-link` attribute to the element.

<details>

<summary>Vanilla JS</summary>

To show the embed as a popup on clicking an element, simply add `data-cal-link` attribute to the element.

  <button data-cal-link="jane" data-cal-config="A valid config JSON"></button>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>React</summary>
  ```jsx
    import "@calcom/embed-react";

    const MyComponent = ()=> {
      return <button data-cal-link="jane" data-cal-config='A valid config JSON'></button>
    }

````

</details>

## Supported Instructions

Consider an instruction as a function with that name and that would be called with the given arguments.

### `inline`

Appends embed inline as the child of the element.

```javascript
Cal("inline", { elementOrSelector, calLink });
````

- `elementOrSelector` - Give it either a valid CSS selector or an HTMLElement instance directly

- `calLink` - Cal Link that you want to embed e.g. john. Just give the username. No need to give the full URL [https://cal.com/john](). It makes it easy to configure the calendar host once and use as many links you want with just usernames

### `ui`

Configure UI for embed. Make it look part of your webpage.

```javascript
Cal("inline", { styles });
```

- `styles` - It supports styling for `body` and `eventTypeListItem`. Right now we support just background on these two.

### preload

Usage:

If you want to open cal link on some action. Make it pop open instantly by preloading it.

```javascript
Cal("preload", { calLink });
```

- `calLink` - Cal Link that you want to embed e.g. john. Just give the username. No need to give the full URL [https://cal.com/john]()

## Actions
You can listen to an action that occurs in embedded cal link as follows. You can think of them as DOM events. We are avoiding the term "events" to not confuse it with Cal Events.
```javascript
Cal("on", {
  action: "ANY_ACTION_NAME",
  callback: (e)=>{
    // `data` is properties for the event.
    // `type` is the name of the action(You can also call it type of the action.) This would be same as "ANY_ACTION_NAME" except when ANY_ACTION_NAME="*" which listens to all the events.
    // `namespace` tells you the Cal namespace for which the event is fired/
    const {data, type, namespace} = e.detail;
  }
})
```

Following are the list of supported actions.
